# 🚀 Quick Setup Guide - Self-Sufficient Repository

## ✅ No Installation Required!

This repository includes everything you need. Just clone and start coding!

### Step 1: Clone Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd soc3050code
```

### Step 2: Verify Environment

**Option A: Simple Check (No PowerShell issues)**
```bash
# Double-click this file or run from command prompt
simple-check.bat
```

**Option B: Full Verification with PowerShell**
```bash
# Double-click this file (handles PowerShell policies automatically)
setup-check.bat

# Or run manually with bypass:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File verify-environment.ps1
```

**Option C: Manual Check**
```bash
# If scripts don't work, manually verify:
# 1. Check if tools/avr-toolchain/bin/avr-gcc.exe exists
# 2. Check if tools/simulide/SimulIDE_1.1.0-SR1_Win64/simulide.exe exists
# 3. Open VS Code with: code .
```

### Step 3: Open in VS Code
```bash
code .
```

### Step 4: Start Coding!
1. Navigate to `projects/` folder
2. Open any project (try `Port_Basic` first)
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "Build Current Project"
4. Connect your ATmega128 and program it!

## 🛠️ What's Bundled

- ✅ Complete AVR-GCC toolchain
- ✅ SimulIDE circuit simulator  
- ✅ ATmega128 device definitions
- ✅ VS Code configuration
