## Implementation Guidelines

### For Main.c Files (Lecture Content):
- Focus on **educational demonstration** and **concept explanation**
- Emphasize **learning objectives** and **progression**
- Include **theoretical background** in comments
- Structure as **guided demonstrations**
- Provide **clear conceptual flow**

### For Lab.c Files (Hands-On Experience):
- Focus on **practical exercises** and **interactive learning**
- Emphasize **hands-on skills** and **problem-solving**
- Include **step-by-step instructions** in comments
- Structure as **progressive challenges**
- Provide **immediate feedback** and **validation**

## Consistency Requirements

1. **Header Format**: All files must use the standardized 77-character width format
2. **Project Naming**: Must match the directory name exactly
3. **Hardware Requirements**: Must reflect actual connections and specifications
4. **Learning Structure**: Must follow logical progression from basic to advanced
5. **Duration/Difficulty**: Lab files must include realistic time estimates

## Updated Projects

The following projects have been updated with standardized preambles:

### Main.c Files Updated:
- ✅ Serial_interrupt/Main.c
- ✅ Port_Basic/Main.c  
- ✅ Timer_Basic/Main.c
- ✅ Serial_Polling/Main.c
- ✅ Interrupt_Basic/Main.c

### Lab.c Files Updated:
- ✅ Port_Basic/Lab.c
- ✅ Timer_Basic/Lab.c

## Remaining Files

The following files still need to be updated with standardized preambles:

### High Priority Main.c Files:
- PWM_Motor_DC/Main.c
- SPI_Master_Basic/Main.c
- I2C_Master_Basic/Main.c
- LCD_Character_Basic/Main.c
- ADC_Basic/Main.c

### High Priority Lab.c Files:
- Serial_Polling/Lab.c
- Interrupt_Basic/Lab.c
- PWM_Motor_DC/Lab.c
- SPI_Master_Basic/Lab.c
- I2C_Master_Basic/Lab.c

## Next Steps

1. Continue updating remaining Main.c files with lecture-focused preambles
2. Update remaining Lab.c files with hands-on focused preambles
3. Ensure all hardware requirements are accurate and up-to-date
4. Verify learning progressions are pedagogically sound
5. Review all preambles for consistency and completeness
